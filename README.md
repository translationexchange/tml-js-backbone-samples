TML Samples for backbone.js 
===

This sample application uses "Backbone Directory" which was originally created by Christophe Coenraets.

Original source:

https://github.com/ccoenraets/directory-backbone-bootstrap

"Backbone Directory" is a simple Employee Directory application built with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) and [Twitter Bootstrap] (http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/).

Refer to [this blog post](http://coenraets.org/blog/2013/04/sample-application-with-backbone-js-and-twitter-bootstrap-updated-and-improved/) for more information about the application.
